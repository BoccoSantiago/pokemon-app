              Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pok√©mon. It is covered in yellow
              fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small
              mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each
              cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity
              storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and
              its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning
              bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a
              V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of
              a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to
              stand and walk on its hind legs.
